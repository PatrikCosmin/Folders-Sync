**delete_readonly(path):** Deletes a file at the specified path. If the file is read-only and the operating system is Windows, the function uses PowerShell to delete the file. Otherwise, it tries to delete the file using os.remove. If os.remove raises an OSError with an error number of errno.EACCES (which indicates a permissions error), the function calls subprocess.call to run a sudo rm command that deletes the file as the superuser.

**get_file_hash(path):** Calculates the md5 hash of the contents of a file at the specified path and returns the hash as a hexadecimal string.

**synchronize_folders(source_folder, destination_folder, logger):** Synchronizes the files and subfolders in the source and destination folders. For each file and subfolder in the destination folder, the function checks if it exists in the source folder and if it has been modified since the last synchronization. If it has been modified, the function copies the new version from the source folder to the destination folder. If it does not exist in the source folder, the function deletes it from the destination folder. For each file and subfolder in the source folder, the function checks if it exists in the destination folder. If it does not exist, the function copies it to the destination folder. The function handles subfolders recursively.

**main():** The main function of the program. Parses command-line arguments, checks if the source and destination folders are valid directories, sets up logging to both the console and an optional log file, registers a signal handler to handle interruptions by the user, and runs a loop that repeatedly synchronizes the folders with a specified interval between synchronizations.

In addition to these functions, the program also includes some code that imports modules, defines constants, sets up logging, and checks if the program is being run as a script or imported as a module.
