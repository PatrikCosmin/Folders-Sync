**delete_readonly_file(path):** This function takes a path argument and tries to delete the file at that path. If the file is read-only, it calls a subprocess to use PowerShell to forcibly remove the file. Otherwise, it uses the os.remove() function to delete the file. It will also handle cases where program is runned on Linux operating system and switch to elevated privileges.

**get_file_hash(path):** This function takes a file path argument and returns the MD5 hash of the file contents. It reads the file in chunks of a certain size (chosen based on the file size) and updates an MD5 hash object with each chunk. Finally, it returns the hexdigest of the hash object.

**synchronize_folders(source_folder, destination_folder, logger):** This function takes three arguments: the paths to the source and destination folders, and a logger object for logging messages. It synchronizes the two folders by comparing the files in the destination folder with those in the source folder. If a file exists in the destination folder but not the source folder, it is deleted. If a file exists in both folders but has different contents, it is copied from the source to the destination. If a file exists in both folders and has the same contents, nothing is done. If a subfolder exists in the destination but not the source, it is deleted. If a subfolder exists in both folders, the function is called recursively to synchronize the subfolders. Finally, any files or subfolders in the source folder that do not exist in the destination folder are copied or created in the destination folder.

**main():** This is the main function of the script. It uses the argparse module to parse command-line arguments for the source and destination folders, synchronization interval, and log file. It sets up logging handlers for the log file and console output, sets up a logger object, and sets a flag to stop the synchronization loop. It sets up a signal handler to catch SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and set the stop flag. Finally, it enters a loop that calls synchronize_folders() at the specified interval, logging messages before and after each synchronization, until the stop flag is set. At that point, it logs a message and exits.
